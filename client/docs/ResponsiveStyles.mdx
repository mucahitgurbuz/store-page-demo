# Responsive Styles

```
We use the @media(min-width) media queries to ensure values are mobile-first.
```

## What it does

This shortcut is an alternative to writing media queries out by hand. Given the following:

```js
<Box width={[1, 1 / 2, 1 / 4]} />
```

It'll generate a CSS that looks like this

```js

.Box {
  width: 100%;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 40em) {
  .Box {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 52em) {
  .Box {
    width: 25%;
  }
}
```

The equivalent of this style if you passed it as an object.

```
// First, create an alias for breakpoints
const breakpoints = ["30em", "48em", "62em", "80em"];
// aliases
breakpoints.sm = breakpoints[0];
breakpoints.md = breakpoints[1];
breakpoints.lg = breakpoints[2];
breakpoints.xl = breakpoints[3];
```

then

```
<Box width={{ base: 1, sm: 1 / 2, md: 1 / 4 }} />
```
